I have created a Django project.d. 

Superuser Login id and password:

userid: admin
password: admin

In this project you can add Category, subcategory and product and CRUD operations for all the parameters.

Now you will be in the root directory of the project. You can run the server by this command:

>> python manage.py runserver
